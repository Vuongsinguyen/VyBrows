Thank you very much to everyone including Vy and Emily they were all so welcoming. The whole process only took a couple hours. Kim truly has an eye for detail and symmetry and takes into account your face shape. I was very comfortable throughout the whole process with little to no pain. I recommended this service to anyone that just wants to wake up a little more put together without the time and money it takes to do traditionally with makeup. Xoxo - Lily"
