desc: "I recently visited VyBrows Academy and had an amazing experience! The space is clean, welcoming, and professionally run. Emily is incredibly talented and made me feel so comfortable throughout the process. My brows have never looked better, natural, symmetrical, and exactly what I was hoping for. You can tell she really cares about her craft and her clients. Highly recommend to anyone considering brow tattoos or shaping. You wonâ€™t be disappointed!"
