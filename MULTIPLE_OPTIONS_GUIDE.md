# Multiple Options Booking System - Implementation Guide

## Overview
The booking system has been updated to support selecting multiple options per booking submission. When multiple options are selected, each option will create a separate row in Google Sheets.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Changes (BookingStepSectionModern.js)

#### Data Structure Updates
- Changed `booking.option` (string) to `booking.options` (array)
- Updated state reset function to initialize options as empty array

#### UI Updates
- **Service Modal**: Changed from radio buttons to checkboxes to allow multiple selections
- **Option Selection**: Now collects multiple checked options into an array
- **Booking Summary**: Updated to display multiple selected options
- **Validation**: Modified to require at least one option instead of exactly one

#### Submission Logic
- **Single Option**: If no options or single option selected, works as before
- **Multiple Options**: Creates separate API calls for each selected option
- **Success Handling**: Shows count of successful submissions
- **Error Handling**: Reports partial failures if some options fail to submit

### 2. Backend Changes (submitBooking.ts)

#### Duplicate Check Logic
- **Previous**: Checked for same date + time only
- **Updated**: Checks for exact duplicate based on:
  - Same date
  - Same time  
  - Same customer name
  - Same service
  - Same option

This allows the same customer to book:
- Different options for the same service at the same time ✅
- Different services at the same time ✅
- But prevents exact duplicate bookings ❌

#### Error Messages
- Updated duplicate error message to be more specific about what constitutes a duplicate

## How It Works

### Frontend Flow
1. Customer selects a service
2. Modal opens with checkboxes for available options
3. Customer can select multiple options
4. When submitting, the system:
   - If 1+ options selected: Creates separate booking request for each option
   - All requests sent in parallel using Promise.all()
   - Shows success/failure count to user

### Backend Flow
1. Each booking request is processed independently
2. Duplicate check ensures no exact duplicates (same customer, service, option, date, time)
3. Each unique booking creates a new row in Google Sheets
4. Returns success/failure for each individual booking

## Example Usage

### Scenario 1: Multiple PMU Options
Customer selects "Combo Brows" service with options ["Natural", "Bold"]
- **Result**: 2 rows in Google Sheets
- **Row 1**: Customer, Combo Brows, Natural, Date, Time
- **Row 2**: Customer, Combo Brows, Bold, Date, Time

### Scenario 2: Different Services Same Time
Customer books both "Combo Brows" and "Lip Blush" at same time
- **Result**: Allowed (2 separate rows)

### Scenario 3: Exact Duplicate
Customer tries to book same service + option + date + time twice
- **Result**: Second attempt blocked with error message

## Testing

Use the `test-multiple-options.js` file to test the functionality:

```javascript
// In browser console when server is running
testMultipleOptionsBooking()
```

This will test:
- Multiple options for same service ✅
- Different services at same time ✅  
- Duplicate detection ❌

## Google Sheets Structure

The Google Sheets structure remains the same:
```
| Timestamp | Category | Service | Option | Date | Time | Name | Phone | Email | Notes | Status |
```

Multiple options create multiple rows with same customer info but different option values.

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Customers can book multiple treatments/options in one session
2. **Clarity**: Each option is clearly tracked as separate booking
3. **No Conflicts**: Different options don't conflict with each other
4. **Audit Trail**: Full visibility of what was booked in Google Sheets
5. **Duplicate Prevention**: Still prevents accidental duplicate bookings

## Future Enhancements

Consider these potential improvements:
1. **Bulk Pricing**: Apply discounts for multiple options
2. **Time Estimation**: Calculate total service time for multiple options
3. **Booking Groups**: Link related bookings with a group ID
4. **Cancellation**: Allow canceling individual options vs entire booking
5. **Scheduling**: Suggest optimal time slots for multiple services
