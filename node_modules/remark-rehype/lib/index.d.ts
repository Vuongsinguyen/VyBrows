/**
 * Plugin that turns markdown into HTML to support rehype.

 *     (hast) tree (bridge-mode).
 *     As the given processor runs with a hast tree, and rehype plugins support
 *     hast, that means rehype plugins can be used with the given processor.
 *     The hast tree is discarded in the end.
 *     Itâ€™s highly unlikely that you want to do this.
 * *   The common case is to not pass a destination processor, in which case the
 *     current processor continues running with a new HTML (hast) tree
 *     (mutate-mode).
 *     As the current processor continues with a hast tree, and rehype plugins
 *     support hast, that means rehype plugins can be used after
 *     `remark-rehype`.
 *     Itâ€™s likely that this is what you want to do.
 *
 * @param destination
 *   Optional unified processor.
 * @param options

/**
 * Turn markdown into HTML.
 *
 * ##### Notes
 *
 * ###### Signature
 *
 * * if a processor is given,
 *   runs the (rehype) plugins used on it with a hast tree,
 *   then discards the result (*bridge mode*)
 * * otherwise,
 *   returns a hast tree,
 *   the plugins used after `remarkRehype` are rehype plugins (*mutate mode*)
 *
 * > ðŸ‘‰ **Note**:
 * > Itâ€™s highly unlikely that you want to pass a `processor`.
 *
 * ###### HTML
 *
 * Raw HTML is available in mdast as `html` nodes and can be embedded in hast
 * as semistandard `raw` nodes.
 * Most plugins ignore `raw` nodes but two notable ones donâ€™t:
 *
 * * `rehype-stringify` also has an option `allowDangerousHtml` which will
 *   output the raw HTML.
 *   This is typically discouraged as noted by the option name but is useful if
 *   you completely trust authors
 * * `rehype-raw` can handle the raw embedded HTML strings by parsing them
 *   into standard hast nodes (`element`, `text`, etc);
 *   this is a heavy task as it needs a full HTML parser,
 *   but it is the only way to support untrusted content
 *
 * ###### Footnotes
 *
 * Many options supported here relate to footnotes.
 * Footnotes are not specified by CommonMark,
 * which we follow by default.
 * They are supported by GitHub,
 * so footnotes can be enabled in markdown with `remark-gfm`.
 *
 * The options `footnoteBackLabel` and `footnoteLabel` define natural language
 * that explains footnotes,
 * which is hidden for sighted users but shown to assistive technology.
 * When your page is not in English,
 * you must define translated values.
 *
 * Back references use ARIA attributes,
 * but the section label itself uses a heading that is hidden with an
 * `sr-only` class.
 * To show it to sighted users,
 * define different attributes in `footnoteLabelProperties`.
 *
 * ###### Clobbering
 *
 * Footnotes introduces a problem,
 * as it links footnote calls to footnote definitions on the page through `id`
 * attributes generated from user content,
 * which results in DOM clobbering.
 *
 * DOM clobbering is this:
 *
 * ```html
 * <p id=x></p>
 * <script>alert(x) // `x` now refers to the DOM `p#x` element</script>
 * ```
 *
 * Elements by their ID are made available by browsers on the `window` object,
 * which is a security risk.
 * Using a prefix solves this problem.
 *
 * More information on how to handle clobbering and the prefix is explained in
 * *Example: headings (DOM clobbering)* in `rehype-sanitize`.
 *
 * ###### Unknown nodes
 *
 * Unknown nodes are nodes with a type that isnâ€™t in `handlers` or `passThrough`.
 * The default behavior for unknown nodes is:
 *
 * * when the node has a `value`
 *   (and doesnâ€™t have `data.hName`, `data.hProperties`, or `data.hChildren`,
 *   see later),
 *   create a hast `text` node
 * * otherwise,
 *   create a `<div>` element (which could be changed with `data.hName`),
 *   with its children mapped from mdast to hast as well
 *
 * This behavior can be changed by passing an `unknownHandler`.
 *

 * @param {Processor} processor
 * @param {Readonly<Options> | null | undefined} [options]
