### `unified().use(retextSmartypants[, options])`

Apply [SmartyPants][].

##### `options`

Configuration (optional).

###### `options.quotes`

Create smart quotes (`boolean`, default: `true`).

Converts straight double and single quotes to smart double or single quotes.
The options `options.openingQuotes` and `options.closingQuotes` affect which
quotes are considered smart.

###### `options.openingQuotes`

Characters to use for opening quotes `{single: '‚Äò', double: '‚Äú'}`.

###### `options.closingQuotes`

Characters to use for closing quotes `{single: '‚Äô', double: '‚Äù'}`.

###### `options.ellipses`

Create smart ellipses (`boolean`, default: `true`).

Converts triple dot characters (with or without spaces) into a single unicode
ellipsis character.

###### `options.backticks`

Create smart quotes from backticks (`boolean` or `'all'`, default: `true`).

When `true`, converts double backticks into an opening double quote, and
double straight single quotes into a closing double quote.

When `'all'`: does the what `true` does with the addition of converting single
backticks into an opening single quote, and a straight single quote into a
closing single smart quote.

> üëâ **Note**: `options.quotes` can not be `true` when `backticks` is `'all'`.

###### `options.dashes`

Create smart dashes (`boolean` or `'oldschool'`, `'inverted'`, default: `true`).

When `true`, converts two dashes into an em dash character.

When `'oldschool'`, converts two dashes into an en dash, and three dashes into
an em dash.

When `'inverted'`, converts two dashes into an em dash, and three dashes into
an en dash.
