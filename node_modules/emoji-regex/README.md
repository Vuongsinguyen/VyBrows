# emoji-regex [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/mathiasbynens/emoji-regex.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/mathiasbynens/emoji-regex)

_emoji-regex_ offers a regular expression to match all emoji symbols and sequences (including textual representations of emoji) as per the Unicode Standard.

This repository contains a script that generates this regular expression based on [Unicode data](https://github.com/node-unicode/node-unicode-data). Because of this, the regular expression can easily be updated whenever new emoji are added to the Unicode standard.

# emoji-regex [![Build status](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/emoji-regex/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/emoji-regex/actions/workflows/main.yml) [![emoji-regex on npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/emoji-regex)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/emoji-regex)

_emoji-regex_ offers a regular expression to match all emoji symbols and sequences (including textual representations of emoji) as per the Unicode Standard. It’s based on [_emoji-test-regex-pattern_](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/emoji-test-regex-pattern), which generates (at build time) the regular expression pattern based on the Unicode Standard. As a result, _emoji-regex_ can easily be updated whenever new emoji are added to Unicode.

Since each version of _emoji-regex_ is tied to the latest Unicode version at the time of release, results are deterministic. This is important for use cases like image replacement, where you want to guarantee that an image asset is available for every possibly matched emoji. If you don’t need a deterministic regex, a lighter-weight, general emoji pattern is available via the [_emoji-regex-xs_](https://github.com/slevithan/emoji-regex-xs) package that follows the same API.

## Installation

Via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install emoji-regex
```

In [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/):

```js
<<<<<<< HEAD
const emojiRegex = require('emoji-regex/RGI_Emoji.js');
=======
const emojiRegex = require('emoji-regex');
>>>>>>> 08f40ceb (Initial)
// Note: because the regular expression has the global flag set, this module
// exports a function that returns the regex rather than exporting the regular
// expression itself, to make it impossible to (accidentally) mutate the
// original regular expression.

const text = `
\u{231A}: ⌚ default emoji presentation character (Emoji_Presentation)
\u{2194}\u{FE0F}: ↔️ default text presentation character rendered as emoji
\u{1F469}: 👩 emoji modifier base (Emoji_Modifier_Base)
\u{1F469}\u{1F3FF}: 👩🏿 emoji modifier base followed by a modifier
`;

const regex = emojiRegex();
<<<<<<< HEAD
let match;
while (match = regex.exec(text)) {
=======
for (const match of text.matchAll(regex)) {
>>>>>>> 08f40ceb (Initial)
  const emoji = match[0];
  console.log(`Matched sequence ${ emoji } — code points: ${ [...emoji].length }`);
}
```

Console output:

```
Matched sequence ⌚ — code points: 1
Matched sequence ⌚ — code points: 1
Matched sequence ↔️ — code points: 2
Matched sequence ↔️ — code points: 2
Matched sequence 👩 — code points: 1
Matched sequence 👩 — code points: 1
Matched sequence 👩🏿 — code points: 2
Matched sequence 👩🏿 — code points: 2
```

## Regular expression flavors

The package comes with three distinct regular expressions:

```js
// This is the recommended regular expression to use. It matches all
// emoji recommended for general interchange, as defined via the
// `RGI_Emoji` property in the Unicode Standard.
// https://unicode.org/reports/tr51/#def_rgi_set
// When in doubt, use this!
const emojiRegexRGI = require('emoji-regex/RGI_Emoji.js');

// This is the old regular expression, prior to `RGI_Emoji` being
// standardized. In addition to all `RGI_Emoji` sequences, it matches
// some emoji you probably don’t want to match (such as emoji component
// symbols that are not meant to be used separately).
const emojiRegex = require('emoji-regex/index.js');

// This regular expression matches even more emoji than the previous
// one, including emoji that render as text instead of icons (i.e.
// emoji that are not `Emoji_Presentation` symbols and that aren’t
// forced to render as emoji by a variation selector).
const emojiRegexText = require('emoji-regex/text.js');
```

Additionally, in environments which support ES2015 Unicode escapes, you may `require` ES2015-style versions of the regexes:

```js
const emojiRegexRGI = require('emoji-regex/es2015/RGI_Emoji.js');
const emojiRegex = require('emoji-regex/es2015/index.js');
const emojiRegexText = require('emoji-regex/es2015/text.js');
```

## For maintainers

### How to update emoji-regex after new Unicode Standard releases

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Update the Unicode data dependency in `package.json` by running the following commands:

    ```sh
    # Example: updating from Unicode v12 to Unicode v13.
    npm uninstall @unicode/unicode-12.0.0
    npm install @unicode/unicode-13.0.0 --save-dev
    ````

1. Generate the new output:

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

1. Verify that tests still pass:

    ```sh
    npm test
    ```

1. Send a pull request with the changes, and get it reviewed & merged.
=======
1. [Update _emoji-test-regex-pattern_ as described in its repository](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/emoji-test-regex-pattern#how-to-update-emoji-test-regex-pattern-after-new-uts51-releases).

1. Bump the _emoji-test-regex-pattern_ dependency to the latest version.

1. Update the Unicode data dependency in `package.json` by running the following commands:

     ```sh
     # Example: updating from Unicode v13 to Unicode v14.
     npm uninstall @unicode/unicode-13.0.0
     npm install @unicode/unicode-14.0.0 --save-dev
     ````

 1. Generate the new output:

     ```sh
     npm run build
     ```

 1. Verify that tests still pass:

     ```sh
     npm test
     ```

### How to publish a new release
>>>>>>> 08f40ceb (Initial)

1. On the `main` branch, bump the emoji-regex version number in `package.json`:

    ```sh
    npm version patch -m 'Release v%s'
    ```

    Instead of `patch`, use `minor` or `major` [as needed](https://semver.org/).

    Note that this produces a Git commit + tag.

1. Push the release commit and tag:

    ```sh
<<<<<<< HEAD
    git push
=======
    git push && git push --tags
>>>>>>> 08f40ceb (Initial)
    ```

    Our CI then automatically publishes the new release to npm.
