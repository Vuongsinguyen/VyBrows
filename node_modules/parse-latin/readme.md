A Latin-script language parser for [**retext**][retext] producing **[nlcst][]**
nodes.

Whether Old-English (“þā gewearþ þǣm hlāforde and þǣm hȳrigmannum wiþ ānum
penninge”), Icelandic (“Hvað er að frétta”), French (“Où sont les toilettes?”),
`parse-latin` does a good job at tokenizing it.

Note also that `parse-latin` does a decent job at tokenizing Latin-like scripts,
Cyrillic (“Добро пожаловать!”), Georgian (“როგორა ხარ?”), Armenian (“Շատ հաճելի
է”), and such.

## Install

This package is ESM only: Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `import`ed
instead of `require`d.

[npm][]:
=======

Natural language parser, for Latin-script languages, that produces [nlcst][].

## What is this?

This package exposes a parser that takes Latin-script natural language and
produces a syntax tree.

## When should I use this?

If you want to handle natural language as syntax trees manually, use this.

Alternatively, you can use the retext plugin [`retext-latin`][retext-latin],
which wraps this project to also parse natural language at a higher-level
(easier) abstraction.

penninge”), Icelandic (“Hvað er að frétta”), French (“Où sont les toilettes?”),
this project does a good job at tokenizing it.

For English and Dutch, you can instead use [`parse-english`][parse-english] and
[`parse-dutch`][parse-dutch].

You can somewhat use this for Latin-like scripts, such as Cyrillic (“привет”),
Georgian (“გამარჯობა”), Armenian (“Բարեւ”), and such.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:
>>>>>>> 08f40ceb (Initial)

```sh
npm install parse-latin
```

## Use

```js
import {inspect} from 'unist-util-inspect'
import {ParseLatin} from 'parse-latin'
=======
In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {ParseLatin} from 'https://esm.sh/parse-latin@7'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {ParseLatin} from 'https://esm.sh/parse-latin@7?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {ParseLatin} from 'parse-latin'
import {inspect} from 'unist-util-inspect'
>>>>>>> 08f40ceb (Initial)

const tree = new ParseLatin().parse('A simple sentence.')

console.log(inspect(tree))
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
Which, when inspecting, yields:

## API

<<<<<<< HEAD
This package exports the following identifiers: `ParseLatin`.
There is no default export.

### `ParseLatin(value)`

Exposes the functionality needed to tokenize natural Latin-script languages into
a syntax tree.
If `value` is passed here, it’s not needed to give it to `#parse()`.

#### `ParseLatin#tokenize(value)`

Tokenize `value` (`string`) into letters and numbers (words), white space, and
everything else (punctuation).
The returned nodes are a flat list without paragraphs or sentences.

###### Returns

[`Array.<Node>`][nlcst] — Nodes.

#### `ParseLatin#parse(value)`

Tokenize `value` (`string`) into an [NLCST][] tree.
The returned node is a `RootNode` with in it paragraphs and sentences.

###### Returns

[`Node`][nlcst] — Root node.

## Algorithm

> Note: The easiest way to see **how parse-latin tokenizes and parses**, is by
> using the [online parser demo][demo], which
> shows the syntax tree corresponding to the typed text.

`parse-latin` splits text into white space, word, and punctuation tokens.
`parse-latin` starts out with a pretty easy definition, one that most other
tokenizers use:

*   A “word” is one or more letter or number characters
*   A “white space” is one or more white space characters
*   A “punctuation” is one or more of anything else

Then, it manipulates and merges those tokens into a ([nlcst][]) syntax tree,
adding sentences and paragraphs where needed.

*   Some punctuation marks are part of the word they occur in, such as
    `non-profit`, `she’s`, `G.I.`, `11:00`, `N/A`, `&c`, `nineteenth- and…`
*   Some full-stops do not mark a sentence end, such as `1.`, `e.g.`, `id.`
*   Although full-stops, question marks, and exclamation marks (sometimes) end a
    sentence, that end might not occur directly after the mark, such as `.)`,
    `."`
*   And many more exceptions

This package exports the identifier [`ParseLatin`][api-parse-latin].
There is no default export.

### `ParseLatin()`

Create a new parser.

#### `ParseLatin#parse(value)`

Turn natural language into a syntax tree.

###### Parameters

*   `value` (`string`, optional)
    — value to parse

###### Returns

Tree ([`RootNode`][root]).

## Algorithm

> 👉 **Note**:

> the typed text.

`parse-latin` splits text into white space, punctuation, symbol, and word
tokens:

*   “word” is one or more unicode letters or numbers
*   “white space” is one or more unicode white space characters
*   “punctuation” is one or more unicode punctuation characters
*   “symbol” is one or more of anything else

Then, it manipulates and merges those tokens into a syntax tree, adding
sentences and paragraphs where needed.

*   some punctuation marks are part of the word they occur in, such as
    `non-profit`, `she’s`, `G.I.`, `11:00`, `N/A`, `&c`, `nineteenth- and…`
*   some periods do not mark a sentence end, such as `1.`, `e.g.`, `id.`
*   although periods, question marks, and exclamation marks (sometimes) end a
    sentence, that end might not occur directly after the mark, such as `.)`,
    `."`
*   …and many more exceptions

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by me are compatible with maintained versions of Node.js.

When I cut a new major release, I drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means I try to keep the current release line, `parse-latin@^7`, compatible
with Node.js 16.

## Security

This package is safe.
