## What is this?

This is a tiny but useful package to convert between arbitrary places in a
file.

## When should I use this?

This utility is useful when ASTs nodes don’t cut it.
For example, when you are making a lint rule that looks for dangerous
characters in a file, which you accomplish by searching the raw file value,
and still want to report it to users.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
<<<<<<< HEAD
In Node.js (version 14.14+ and 16.0+), install with [npm][]:
=======
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:
>>>>>>> 08f40ceb (Initial)

```sh
npm install vfile-location
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
<<<<<<< HEAD
import {location} from 'https://esm.sh/vfile-location@4'
=======
import {location} from 'https://esm.sh/vfile-location@5'
>>>>>>> 08f40ceb (Initial)
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
<<<<<<< HEAD
  import {location} from 'https://esm.sh/vfile-location@4?bundle'
=======
  import {location} from 'https://esm.sh/vfile-location@5?bundle'
>>>>>>> 08f40ceb (Initial)
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {VFile} from 'vfile'
import {location} from 'vfile-location'

const place = location(new VFile('foo\nbar\nbaz'))

const offset = place.toOffset({line: 3, column: 3}) // => 10
place.toPoint(offset) // => {line: 3, column: 3, offset: 10}
```

## API

<<<<<<< HEAD
This package exports the identifier [`location`][api-location].
There is no default export.

### `location(file)`

Index the given document so you can translate between line/column and offset
based positional info.

###### Parameters

*   `file` (`string`, `Buffer`, or [`VFile`][vfile])
    — file to index

###### Returns

Accessors for index ([`Location`][api-location-map]).

### `Location`

Accessors for index (TypeScript type).

###### Fields

*   `toPoint` (`(offset?: number) => Point`)
    — get a line/column-based [`Point`][point] from `offset`
*   `toOffset` (`(point?: Point) => number`)
    — get an offset from a line/column-based [`point`][point]
=======
### `Location`

Accessors for index.

###### Fields

* `toOffset` (`(point?: PointLike | null | undefined) => number | undefined`)
  — get the `offset` from a line/column based `Point` in the bound indices;
  returns `undefined` when given out of bounds input
* `toPoint` (`(offset?: number | null | undefined) => UnistPoint | undefined`)
  — get the line/column based `Point` for `offset` in the bound indices;
  returns `undefined` when given out of bounds input

### `location(file)`

Create an index of the given document to translate between line/column and
offset based positional info.

Also implemented in Rust in [`wooorm/markdown-rs`][markdown-rs].

###### Parameters

* `file` (`VFile | Value`)
  — file to index

###### Returns

Accessors for index (`Location`).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional type [`Location`][api-location-map].

## Compatibility

<<<<<<< HEAD
Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 14.14+ and 16.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.
=======
Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line, `vfile-location@^5`,
compatible with Node.js 16.
