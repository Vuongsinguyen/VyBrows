**Solution**: ✅ Already fixed! Use `disavow-links-clean.txt`

**Why it happened:**
- Old file had UTF-8 BOM or special characters

**Our fix:**
- Created clean ASCII text file
- No comments, just domain list
- Unix line endings (LF)

### Error 2: "File is too large"
**Max size**: 2MB or 100,000 URLs
**Our file**: ~150 bytes (0.00015 MB) ✅ OK
